Nothing done yet!
GEORGE is a new project actually on design phase.

The goal is to create a easily understandable Domain
Specific Language to declare and solve problems using
various metaheuristics, being simple enough for non-
programmers to be able to use it in a straight-forward
manner, but powerful and flexible enough to let expert
users tweak it for their advanced needs.
